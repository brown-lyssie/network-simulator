# Network Simulator
Created by Lyssie Brown and Liam Prior
## Purpose

**What it is**: A simple simulator for a network of hosts and links that each have some probability of failure.

**Why we created it**: Final project for Computer Engineering 400 (Networks) at UNR.

## Overview
Python version 3.8.10 (ish)

Convention: return 0 if successful, return -1 if error (except main)

This is a simulator.


## Plans

Implement Simulator class
- Prompts events to happen within hosts
- Has a priority queue
